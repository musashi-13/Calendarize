A prototype project made for hackathon that tries to make the lives of college students easier.

*Problem Statement:*

Many students are overwhelmed by all the events that take place in their colleges/university and the multiple sources they have to refer to get to know about said events.

*Solution:*

A website that combines all the data available and displays them along with categories and links, in one page so that the user can be informed. Website also has a AI Assistant that can answer queries.
Tech Stack - Next.js App

*Possible Future Features:*

A mail parser so that all the sources can just send us a mail (could be the same mail that they send to all students) and parse it to extract the event data to add to our website automatically.
